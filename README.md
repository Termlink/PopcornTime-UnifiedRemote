# PopcornTime Remote 
Original project hasn't been updated in years so I decided to fix it, doesn't use the API as its too stable.

A simple keyboard mapped remote for [PopcornTime](https://popcorntime.sh)

## Features
* **Main Interface tab** - Search videos, Navigation controls, Tab selection, Season Selection
* **Video Player tab** - Control playback, Volume, Fullscreen toggle, Skip back/ahead

## Future features
PopcornTime remote was made with keyboard input in mind, when PopcornTime hopefully matures with an API the remote will be updated to replace keyboard input with an interface that reflects PopcornTime's UI.
